You can send a message to a slack channel using the integration `incoming-webhook`

// the HOOK_URL is provided by the integration
const HOOK_URL = ''
got.post(HOOK_URL, {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    username: 'RED BUTTON',
    text: `I've been pressed!`,
    icon_url: 'https://i.imgur.com/9PpFcY8.jpg'
  })
})
```

## Troubleshooting

> The keypress commands are being launched but nothing is happening, wtf??

If you're on a mac, you probably forgot to give permissions to your console application.

Go into `Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility` and make sure the terminal app you're using is checked.
